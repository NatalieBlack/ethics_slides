                  <p>Background on this lesson:</p> 
                  <p>it’s the first time we’ve done it</p>
                  <p>I (and I think other bitmaker people) have wanted it to exist for a long time</p>
                  <p>I didn’t want to be responsible and I don’t think anyone else did either</p>
                  <p>I’m not an expert or authority on what is ethical or moral. My perspective and experiences are limited like everyone else’s.</p>
                  <p>But I am in a position of power</p>
                  <p>But that attitude - trying to escape responsibility, especially when you are in a position of power - is a problem in the tech world.</p>
                  <p>A lot of us have the tendency to not want to attempt something unless we feel confident that we can succeed at it.</p> 
                  <p>Not trying is a way of trying to avoid accountability</p>
                  <p>Acknowledge that it’s important, that it’s hard, and that none of us have the answers</p>
                  <p>Try anyway</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Seek out the opinions of others</p>
                  <li>Think critically</p>
                  </ul>

                  <p>I’m going to try to point out some topics and questions that I think are important to think critically about.  And where possible I’ll try to provide concrete things or actions you can do.  I hope after having heard this talk you will at least be tuned in to some lines of questioning that you weren’t before, even if you don’t agree with my personal opinions on these issues that I’m inevitably going to inject in this talk.</p>

                  <p>I’m going to be talking about the ways in which people can be harmed by technology and decisions technologists make. Some of this content might be upsetting or hard to hear for some of you, so if you feel the need to tune out, leave the room, put in headphones, or whatever, that’s totally allowed.  If you want to give me feedback later on any of the content or delivery of this lesson, I’ll try my best to listen with an open mind.</p>

            <p><b><u>Computers have a central and growing role in </u></b>commerce, industry, government, medicine, education, entertainment and <b><u>society at large.</u></b> Software engineers are those who contribute by direct participation or by teaching, to the analysis, specification, design, development, certification, maintenance and testing of software systems. Because of their roles in developing software systems, software engineers have <b><u>significant opportunities to do </u></b>good or cause harm, <b><u>to enable </u></b>others to do good or cause harm, or <b><u>to influence others to do good or cause harm.</u></b> To ensure, as much as possible, that their efforts will be used for good, software engineers <b><u>must commit themselves to making software engineering a beneficial and respected profession</u></b>. In accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall adhere to the following Code of Ethics and Professional Practice.</p>

            <p style="margin: 0;">http://www.acm.org/about/se-code</p>
            <p>[...] These Principles should influence software engineers to consider broadly who is affected by their work; to examine if they and their colleagues are treating other human beings with due respect; to consider how the public, if reasonably well informed, would view their decisions; to analyze how the least empowered will be affected by their decisions; and to consider whether their acts would be judged worthy of the ideal professional working as a software engineer. In all these judgments concern for the health, safety and welfare of the public is primary; that is, the "Public Interest" is central to this Code.</p>

          <p>"Thick Data is data brought to light using qualitative, ethnographic research methods that uncover people’s emotions, stories, and models of their world.It’s the sticky stuff that’s difficult to quantify. It comes to us in the form of a small sample size and in return we get an incredible depth of meanings and stories. Thick Data is the opposite of Big Data, which is quantitative data at a large scale that involves new technologies around capturing, storing, and analyzing. For Big Data to be analyzable, it must use normalizing, standardizing, defining, clustering, all processes that strips the the data set of context, meaning, and stories. Thick Data can rescue Big Data from the context-loss that comes with the processes of making it usable."</p>

          <p>Sadly, they can’t. Data and data sets are not objective; they are creations of human design. We give numbers their voice, draw inferences from them, and define their meaning through our interpretations. Hidden biases in both the collection and analysis stages present considerable risks, and are as important to the big-data equation as the numbers themselves."</p>

          <p>‘In our attempt to 'feed the world to software', techies have built the greatest surveillance apparatus the world has ever seen. Unlike earlier efforts, this one is fully mechanized and in a large sense autonomous. Its power is latent, lying in the vast amounts of permanently stored personal data about entire populations.</p>
          <p>We started out collecting this information by accident, as part of our project to automate everything, but soon realized that it had economic value. We could use it to make the process self-funding. And so mechanized surveillance has become the economic basis of the modern tech industry.’ - Maciej Cegłowski</p>

          <p>Companies that perform surveillance are attempting the same mental trick. They assert that we freely share our data in return for valuable services. But opting out of surveillance capitalism is like opting out of electricity, or cooked foods—you are free to do it in theory. In practice, it will upend your life. - Maciej Cegłowski</p>

        <p>Anyone producing, managing or sharing data that reflects on individuals has a responsibility to do so in a way that respects the rights and dignity of people reflected in the data, and avoids doing harm. During a typical development project, this will involve a number of team members working across the project life cycle, from planning to data collection, analysis, publication and outreach. Thinking about these issues can be difficult, and it’s a reasonably new area of thought; to do this responsibly requires a concerted effort by all team members, especially bringing together different disciplines and perspectives.</p>

          <p>Their paper proposed a definition of “nondiscrimination” that requires the error rates between groups be equalized. Otherwise, Srebro said, one group ends up “paying the price for the uncertainty” of the algorithm.</p>
          <p>The need to look at the harms that arise when a test is inaccurate arises frequently in statistics, particularly in fields like health care.</p>

          <p>"programmers are trained to seek maximal and global solutions. Why solve a specific problem in one place when you can fix the general problem for everybody, and for all time? We don't think of this as hubris, but as a laudable economy of effort.[...]There is powerful social pressure to avoid incremental change, particularly any change that would require working with people outside tech and treating them as intellectual equals."</p>

          <p>"In the real world, this has led to a pathology where the tech sector maximizes its own comfort. [...] take a look at Oakland, or take a stroll through downtown San Francisco [...] You'll see a residential theme park for tech workers, surrounded by areas of poverty and misery that have seen no benefit and ample harm from [the tech industry's] presence. We pretend that by maximizing our convenience and productivity, we're hastening the day when we finally make life better for all those other people."</p>
